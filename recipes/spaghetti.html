        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Spaghetti</li>
            <li>Ground Meat</li>
            <li>Tomatoes and Tomato Paste</li>
            <li>Onion, Garlic, and Spices</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Brown the meat:</strong><p>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. Use a wooden spoon to break the meat into smaller crumbles as the meat cooks.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Build the sauce:</strong><p>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once in a while, until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Add liquid and tomatoes:</strong><p>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, ¾ teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Simmer:</strong><p>Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook uncovered for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly (see notes for seasoning suggestions).</p></li>
            <li><strong>Cook spaghetti:</strong><p>About 15 minutes before the spaghetti sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Then, cook the pasta according to the package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time. Drain.</p></li>
