            <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong><p>In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and pumpkin spice until evenly blended.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Mix the wet ingredients:</strong><p>In a large bowl, whisk the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and melted butter. If you see any large lumps of brown sugar, break them up. Then, whisk in the eggs, vanilla, and pumpkin puree until smooth and well combined.</p></li>
